\chapter{User Manual}
\label{chap:usermanual}

At the time of writing, \SS{} is not fully implemented, and some automations are yet missing in the launch of the process of a data stream.
The following sections explain how the current implementation works, and how to run the proof-of-concept which \SS{} have been evaluated on.

\SS{} is running on a legacy standalone \textsc{Docker Swarm} cluster using an overlay network\footnote{\textsc{Docker} overlay network: \url{https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/\#overlay-networks-in-swarm-mode}.}.
First of all, a \textsc{Docker Swarm} cluster have to be deployed on top of a group of hosts.
Then each processing code has to be defined in separated files.
Finally, the process of the stream can be launched from the manager of the \textsc{Docker Swarm} cluster using a \textsc{Docker Compose} file.
Have a look to the Section~\ref{sec:pocusage} to get an idea of how \SS{} can be used.
